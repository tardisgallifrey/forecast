# Weather and Forecast App in React

I have been working on learning how to write web apps in [React](https://reactjs.org) for over two years.  

Though most of the language and technology was not difficult to learn, the ability to write, without looking up how to do so, an effective API call escaped me.  Therefore, I've committed myself to sitting down regularly and writing apps that do that pretty exclusively.

This app is the result of that work.  I found a site called [RapdiAPI](https://rapidapi.com).  It is a collection of free and not so free API endpoints that one can use.  I am using WeatherAPI.

This app is able to give a short current weather picture (may modify over time) and then a decent three day forecast (Three because that quantity is free.).  I am using useEffect() in a promise mode to read from and GET the weather from any US zip code (can do some foreign post codes as well).

I will work on the CSS more as time goes by.  My motto is "Dave does not do pretty", and it shows.

Please feel free to use this app with your own account on WeatherAPI, but as always, do so at your own risk.
